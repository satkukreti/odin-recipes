  <h2>Description</h2>
  <h3>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</h3>

  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve over rice with naan.
